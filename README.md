# Battery Checker for MacOS

The following scripts will install an agent which notifies you whenever your battery is outside of the healthy range (20% - 70%). 

To install:
Make sure install is executable with
``` chmod +x install ```
and run install 
``` ./install ```

To uninstall:
Make sure clean in executable (```chmod +x clean```)
and run clean
``` ./clean ```

If you see anything printed to the terminal, something went wrong with cleaning.
